Hackathon to end Hunger
-----------------------

Very quickly hacked-together code to demonstrate an idea for the [Hackathon to End Hunger][ht]
 event in Chicago (24th Sep 2016). It's an Android app to act as a loyatly program to encourage 
 teenage kids in need to pick up food from their local [GCFD](http://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/) location.
